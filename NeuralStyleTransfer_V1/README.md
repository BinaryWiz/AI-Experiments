# Neural Style Transfer with Tensorflow V1

## Realizations
* I decided to try to make NST with little knowledge of Tensorflow 2.0 going into it
* That was a mistake
* I did not know how to use Tensorflow variables, properly normalize using Numpy, get the gradients and use tf.Function
* The code is also very sloppy and does not work
* I will try to implement this once again after going through the Tensorflow guide this time
